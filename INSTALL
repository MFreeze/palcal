+---------------------------------------------------------+

----- 1.1: Directly from source -----

1) Untar/unzip the pal-x.x.x.tgz package:
	tar -xzf pal-x.x.x.tgz
	cd pal-x.x.x/src

2) (Optional) By default, pal is installed into directories under
   /usr.  Some distributions usually install things to /usr/local.  To
   change where pal will be installed to, change the "prefix" line at
   the top of Makefile.defs.

3) Compile pal
	make

4) Install pal:

   WITH root access: Run "make install" as root.  This will install
   several files including the pal binary, global calendar files, and
   the man page.  (Special note to developers: Use "make
   install-no-rm" if you don't want the install process to attempt to
   remove old pal files.  This is useful for when creating a package
   file for package managers such as portage or rpm.)

   WITHOUT root access; single user: Run "mkdir ~/.pal" as the user
   you want to run pal as.  Copy the pal-x.x.x/pal.conf file and
   whatever calendars you want from pal-x.x.x/share into ~/.pal.  To
   view the man page, run "man pal-x.x.x/pal.1.template".


5) (Optional) Delete pal-x.x.x.tgz and the pal-x.x.x directory.

6) Run pal by typing "pal" at the commandline.  This will create
   ~/.pal and ~/.pal/pal.conf if they do not already exist.

7) Customize
	- Explore settings in ~/.pal/pal.conf
	- You can create your own calendar file in ~/.pal and tell pal
          to load them by making changes to ~/.pal/pal.conf.  For more
          information see pal's man page.


TO UNINSTALL, run "make uninstall" in src while root.


----- 1.2: RPM-Based distributions -----
        (.tgz -> .src.rpm -> .rpm)

1) Generate the .src.rpm file.  As root, run:
	rpmbuild -ts pal-x.x.x.tgz

2) Compile the .src.rpm file to a .rpm file.  As root, run (where
   SRCRPMFILE is the filename that was displayed in while running the
   command in step 1):
	rpmbuild --rebuild SRCRPMFILE

3) Install as root.  Where RPMFILE is the filename displayed at the
   end of the output of the step 2.

   If installing for the first time:
	rpm -ivh RPMFILE

   If upgrading a previous installation:
	rpm -Uvh RPMFILE

4) (Optional) Remove unneeded files: pal-x.x.x.tgz, RPMFILE and
   SRCRPMFILE

5) Follow steps 6 and 7 in the section above (Installing DIRECTLY FROM
   SOURCE).


TO UNINSTALL, run the following command as root:
	rpm -e pal

| 2: Compilation and installation of ical2pal & pal2ical  |
+---------------------------------------------------------+

ical2pal and pal2ical are conversion utilities that convert calendars
between pal's calendar format and the ical format (RFC 2445).

You must have libical (http://www.softwarestudio.org/libical/)
installed to compile and use the conversion utilities.  You do not
need to install the utilities to use pal.

NOTE: ical2pal and pal2ical are very new and likely contain bugs.

1) Untar/unzip the pal-x.x.x.tgz package:
	tar -xzf pal-x.x.x.tgz
	cd pal-x.x.x/src/convert

2) make ical

3) make ical-install
