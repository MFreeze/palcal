	* Fixed: file_hide feature

	deprecated in favor of -m).

	* Events can be sorted by times in event description.  The time
	must be in 24-hour time format (h:mm or hh:mm).  If more than one
	time is in the event description, the first time is used for
	sorting.  Events with times in them are sorted and shown before
	all other events in the -r output.  Events that do not have times
	in them are still sorted by the order they were loaded by
	~/.pal/pal.conf.

	* When event text contains !YYYY! (example !1900!), that text will
	be replaced with the number of years since the year YYYY.

	* Added basic reminders of individual events through the use of

	internationalization section.  Rewrote text wrapping code to work
	properly with multibyte UTF-8 characters.  When using -a, pal
	attempts to convert user input to UTF-8 before writing to calendar
	file.

	* Wrote translation instructions in po/README

	* Added a note when creating a new calendar file with "pal -a"
	that you need to update ~/.pal/pal.conf in order to see the events
	in that calendar.

	* Minor Makefile improvements

	* CSS can now be easily used to style the output of --html


version 0.3.0 (8 Nov 2003)
	* Added ability to assign colors to different .pal files in
	pal.conf

	* It is now possible to limit a recurring event to be between two
	dates.  For example a yearly event on Jan 5th on years 2003 and
	2004 can be written as: 00000105:20030101:20050101.  The first
	date is a yearly event on Jan 5th.  The second date is the
	"starting" date and the 3rd date is the ending date.

	* Interactively add events to .pal files with -a.  It can add all
	types of events: one-time, recurring and recurring with start/end
	dates.

	* Added TODO keyword to be used before events in a calendar file.
	TODO can be used for events that always happen on the day that pal
	is being run on.  This works well for reminding yourself daily of
	something in a todo list.

	* Added DAILY keyword to be used before events in a calendar file.
	Unlike TODO, DAILY events happen every day (not only on the
	current day).

	* Added MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT and SUN keywords to be used
	before events in a calendar file.  These events occur weekly.

	* Removed the yyyy00dd keyword in calendar files that was
	previously used to allow a monthly event to occur in only one
	year.  This type of event can now be defined with the new
	recurring event start/end dates.

	* The date keywords (such as "Easter" and "TODO") in calendar
	files are now case insensitive.

	* Fixed a bug in the display of *mmnd events that occured
	sometimes.

	* Basic HTML output filter implemented (--html)

	* Slightly changed the format of event listings.  Removed []'s and
	made dates bold.

	loaded in the pal.conf file when there is > 1 event on a day.

	files)

	* -r can be used to display events that already happened.

	* The range set with -r is now relative to the current date or a
	date used with -d.

	* The word "range" describes what "-r" does better than
	"reminders."


version 0.2.3 (11 Aug 2003)
	* IMPORTANT: Fixed expunging problems with global files.  If you
	ran pal 0.2.2 with the -x argument, it is likely that some global
	pal files got copied from /use/share/pal to ~/.pal.  It is
	recommended that you delete these copies if you want to see future
	updates to the global calendars provided with pal.

	* -x now expects number of days (not weeks) for consistency with
	other arguments.

	* Fixed mistakes in man page

	* Removed unneeded colorization of blank spaces
